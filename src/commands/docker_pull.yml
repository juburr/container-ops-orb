  Pull one or more container images from a registry.
  This is useful for pre-pulling base images before a build, especially when
  using Docker's --pull flag would fail because some base images only exist
  locally (e.g., images built with apko/melange).

parameters:
  images:
    type: string
    description: |
      Space-separated list of images to pull from the registry.
      Example: "ghcr.io/myorg/base:latest gcr.io/project/runtime:v1"
      Pull failures are treated as warnings since images may exist locally.

steps:
  - run:
      name: Docker Pull Base Images
      environment:
        PARAM_IMAGES: << parameters.images >>
      command: << include(scripts/docker/pull.sh) >>
